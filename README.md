# Hanna Adenholm Portfolio
Official portfolio for Hanna Adenholm, displaying projects and  work she has been involved in.


# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-react.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```sh
  cd portfolio-react
  ```
3. Install the dependencies:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:
```sh
npm run build
```
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment

You can deploy the contents of the `dist/` directory, created after building, to any static hosting service.

The project uses the package ``gh-pages`` for deployment. To do so, run:
```sh
npm run deploy
```

NOTE: there is also a script to both build and deploy the site

```sh
npm run build-and-deploy
```
